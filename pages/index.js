              I used to use "Agile." Then I used "agile." Now I no longer use
              the word at all. It started as a principle, it endured as a
              buzzword, and it ended on the tailend of a fad.

                Standup is for telling folks know what you're doing right now
                and what you might work on shortly. It's not a race, it's not a
                compeition, it's not a game. It's a brief nexus to coordinate,
                it's a place for a humble plea for help.

            <p>
              Points are silly. Work is not continuous. Teams are not uniform.
              Knowledge is not yet learned, expertise is not yet felt. Points
              are a desperate plea to commomiditize the so-called delivery of
              software. How many points did you do this sprint? More? Awesome.
              Less? Grossly unacceptable. The discussion of value and the
              exploration of problem and solution space, what's is important
              here. Points are not.

              It's not intellectual faffery, but it might as well be. It's when
              you decide that an interesting architecture matters more than the
              product in someone's hands or it even working. By all means, use

              You listen to customers. You build what they want. You build what
